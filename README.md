A React application for managing users and their blog posts, built with Redux for state management and React Router for navigation.

## Get started

Run `yarn install` and `yarn start`

## Features

🏆 Performant user table with expandable rows displaying blog posts.
🔗 Navigation support – clicking a blog post updates the URL and opens a dedicated page.
✏️ CRUD operations – users can add, edit, and delete blog posts and users.
🔙 Back button for easy navigation.
📱 Responsive design with a clean UI.
🚀 Bonus features:

## Data Handling (Mock API)

- The application uses a mocked API located in the src/data directory. This API exposes methods to:
- Fetch users and blog posts
- Delete users and blog posts
- Update blog post information
- This allows the app to simulate real API interactions without needing a backend.
